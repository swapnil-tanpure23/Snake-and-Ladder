Snake and Ladder is a project developed using Java programming language and JavaFX framework. 
This project is a game that utilizes the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms. 
The game is designed to simulate the classic board game, where players take turns rolling a dice and moving their pieces along the board based on the number they roll. 
The game board features a grid of squares, with some squares containing snakes that can cause players to slide down the board, and others containing ladders that can help players climb up the board. 
The game logic is implemented using various data structures and algorithms, including arrays, loops, conditional statements, and random number generation. 
The user interface is developed using JavaFX, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. 
Overall, Snake and Ladder is a fun and engaging project that demonstrates the power of DSA skills in building interesting and challenging games.
